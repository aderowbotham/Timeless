Timeless
--------

Timeless is a bit of fun / JavaScript familiarisation exercise.

It produces what appears to be a a malfunctioning 7-segment digital clock, where each of the digits produced is not a recognisable number. It was inspired by what was the broken clock on platform 13 at London Bridge Railway Station.
