Timeless is a bit of fun / JavaScript familiarisation exercise.

It produces what appears to be a a malfunctioning 7-segment digital clock, where each of the digits produced is not a recognisable number. It was inspired by what was the broken clock on platform 13 at London Bridge Railway Station.

Setting up
----------

The page loads the collated and minified JS and CSS files `timeless-min.js` and `timeless.css`. The CSS and JS source are outside of the `deploy` directory, and I've used [Collate](https://npmjs.org/package/collate) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) respectively to minify them (see the included shell scripts if you're interested in that)

Demo
----
There is a working demo at [here](https://dev.adeweb.co.uk/timeless/)
